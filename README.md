# Bricker Game – Java OOP Project

Bricker is a Java-based arcade game inspired by classic brick-breaker mechanics. The game features a modular design built around collision strategies, a central game manager, and multiple interactive game objects. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball, break bricks, and collect power-ups.

The project showcases object-oriented design, encapsulation, and extensibility through strategy patterns. It includes various collision behaviors (extra balls, extra life, turbo mode, AI paddle, and more), a graphical and numeric life system, and special objects that manage their own lifecycle inside the game world.
